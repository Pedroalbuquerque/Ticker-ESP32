# Ticker.h
 This lib mimics the Ticker library from ESP8266 package to make code compatible with ESP32
 for this library to work properly it should be installed in ESP32 package folder
  assuming ESP32 package has been installed a folder named Projects/hardware/espressif/esp32 should exist
 and a subfolder named Ticker must be created there
 it will only be available when ESP32 board is selected, but unavailable for other boards

## Restrictions
 This implementation of Ticker, makes use of timer 0 so any other need in your sketch should avoid timer 0
 and use any other available timer
