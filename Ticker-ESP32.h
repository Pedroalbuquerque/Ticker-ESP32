 //
 // This lib mimics the Ticker library from ESP8266 package to make code compatible with ESP32
 // for this library to work properly it should be installed in ESP32 package folder
 //  assuming ESP32 package has been installed a folder named Projects/hardware/espressif/esp32 should exist
 // and a subfolder named Ticker must be created there
 // it will only be available when ESP32 board is selected, but unavailable for other boards
 //
 // This implementation of Ticker, makes use of timer 0 so any other need in your sketch should avoid timer 0
 // and use any other available timer
